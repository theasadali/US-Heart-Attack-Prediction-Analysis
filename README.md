# US-Heart-Attack-Prediction-Analysis
### SQL Project Assignment for Junior Data Analyst
**Project Title:** Heart Attack Risk Analysis Using SQL
### Objective:
Analyze the given dataset to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart attacks using SQL queries.
### Tasks & Requirements:
1. Data Understanding & Cleaning:
- Create a structured SQL table to store the dataset.
- Handle missing or inconsistent values (e.g., NULLs, incorrect data types).
- Ensure data normalization where necessary.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL Queries:
- Find the average cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI grouped by age group and gender.
- Identify the percentage of smokers and diabetics in the dataset.
- Determine the correlation between hypertension and heart attack occurrences.
- List the top 5 age groups with the highest heart attack cases.
3.	Risk Factor Analysis:
- Check if smokers have a higher probability of heart attacks than non-smokers.
- Analyze the relationship between diabetes and heart attacks.
- Identify if a particular employment status (e.g., unemployed or retired) is linked to higher heart attack rates.
4.	Predictive Insights:
- Create a query to classify patients into "High Risk" and "Low Risk" based on predefined thresholds (e.g., high cholesterol > 200, blood pressure > 140, smoker = 1, diabetes = 1).
- Find the percentage of "High Risk" patients who actually had a heart attack.
### Deliverables:
- SQL scripts for table creation, data cleaning, and analysis queries.
- A summary report (can be a CSV or SQL result export) with key insights.
- Visual representation of key findings (optional, using a BI tool or Excel).
### Tools & Environment:
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any preferred RDBMS).
- Any visualization tool (optional) like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel.
