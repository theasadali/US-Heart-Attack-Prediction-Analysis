# US-Heart-Attack-Prediction-Analysis
### SQL Project Assignment for Junior Data Analyst
Project Title: Heart Attack Risk Analysis Using SQL
##Objective:
Analyze the given dataset to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart attacks using SQL queries.
##Tasks & Requirements:
####1.	Data Understanding & Cleaning:
o	Create a structured SQL table to store the dataset.
o	Handle missing or inconsistent values (e.g., NULLs, incorrect data types).
o	Ensure data normalization where necessary.
####2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL Queries:
o	Find the average cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI grouped by age group and gender.
o	Identify the percentage of smokers and diabetics in the dataset.
o	Determine the correlation between hypertension and heart attack occurrences.
o	List the top 5 age groups with the highest heart attack cases.
####3.	Risk Factor Analysis:
o	Check if smokers have a higher probability of heart attacks than non-smokers.
o	Analyze the relationship between diabetes and heart attacks.
o	Identify if a particular employment status (e.g., unemployed or retired) is linked to higher heart attack rates.
####4.	Predictive Insights:
o	Create a query to classify patients into "High Risk" and "Low Risk" based on predefined thresholds (e.g., high cholesterol > 200, blood pressure > 140, smoker = 1, diabetes = 1).
o	Find the percentage of "High Risk" patients who actually had a heart attack.
Deliverables:
•	SQL scripts for table creation, data cleaning, and analysis queries.
•	A summary report (can be a CSV or SQL result export) with key insights.
•	Visual representation of key findings (optional, using a BI tool or Excel).
Tools & Environment:
•	SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any preferred RDBMS).
•	Any visualization tool (optional) like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel.
